**Background:** Although it is a latecomer, the healthcare industry is increasingly integrating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, this growth has highlighted challenges relating to the trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability. International regulatory bodies, such as the MHRA, the FDA, Health Canada and the European Union are demanding greater transparency and human oversight of AI in clinical systems (GMLP Principles 7 and 9; EU AI Act). This incurs additional resources and requires careful consideration when choosing a model.

**Objective:** This study aims to challenge the assumption that complex, “black-box” ML models always provide a significant advantage over a simple, “glass-box” model for clinical prediction.

**Method:** Using a publicly available CVD dataset (N=62,666), we compared the predictive performance of a GLM (Logistic Regression) against two complex ensemble models: Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). After thorough data cleaning and feature engineering, the models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation and evaluated on an unseen test set. The primary evaluation metric were the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden Index (J-Index). Permutation Feature Importance analysis was employed to pry open the “boxes” and look into the global feature importance among all three models.

**Discussion and Conclusion:** The results showed virtually no difference between the models. GBM achieved the highest AUC (0.7602), with RF (0.7593) and GLM (0.7587) close behind. Additionally, all three models reached a quasi consensus on the most critical global predictors, identifying mean arterial pressure (MAP) and age as the most influential features. The transparent GLM offered acceptable predictive power while providing the necessary interpretability for clinical assistive diagnostics. This aligns with the principle that there is no free-lunch. Considering the regulatory framework, complex models may not always be the best tool.
